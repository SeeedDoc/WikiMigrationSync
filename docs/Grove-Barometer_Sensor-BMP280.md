**Grove - Barometer Sensor (BMP280)** is a breakout board for Bosch BMP280 high-precision and low-power digital barometer. This module can be used to measure **temperature** and **atmospheric pressure** accurately. As the atmospheric pressure changes with altitude, it can also measure approximate **altitude** of a place. It can be connected to a microcontroller with I<sup>2</sup>C (integrated with Grove socket) or through SPI bus. We have also provided highly abstracted library to make this product easier to use.

The BMP280 is an upgraded version of BMP180. BMP280 gets dramatic improvements from BMP180. BMP280 comes with a smaller footprint, lower power consumption, lower noise measurements, higher resolutions for pressure and temperature, lower RMS noise, newly added interface SPI, more measuring modes, higher measuring rate and newly added filter against environmental interference. Since the atmosphere pressure reading is affected by altitude and temperature, we have added compensation features in the library. Hence, Grove - Barometer Sensor (BMP280) would be more reliable in providing precise temperature, atmospheric pressure values and approximate altitude data.

Using the sensor is easy. For [Seeeduino](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Seeeduino-V42-p-2517.html?cPath=6_7) (compliant with Arduino), just connect this breakout board using [Grove cable](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Universal-4-Pin-Buckled-5cm-Cable-5-PCs-Pack-p-925.html?cPath=98_106_57) to I2C Grove connector. Then, use the provided library and example code from GitHub. If you are using an Arduino either use Base Shield v2.0 or simply connect the VCC pin to the 5V voltage pin, GND to ground, SCL to I2C Clock (Analog 5) and SDA to I2C Data (Analog 4).

Typical applications: Enhancement of GPS navigation, outdoor/indoor navigation, weather forecast, or any other project that requires an accurate atmospheric pressure reading.

Hardware Overview
-----------------

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-Barometer_Sensor-BMP280/master/img/Grove-Barometer_Sensor-BMP280-Components_1200_s.jpg)

-   **SPI soldering pads**, a voltage monitoring circuit.
-   **Interface bus selection pads** , to select I<sup>2</sup>C bus, connect the two pads by soldering (this is connected by default); to select SPI bus, cut the two pads with a sharp knife or a soldering iron.
-   **Slave board address selection pads**, to select slave board address to avoid address collision.

If you have selected I2C bus, the default address for slave board is **0x77**(right-two pads are connected). If you want to use the address **0x76**, connect only left two (disconnect right two) by soldering. 

**Tips:** You can disconnect pads with just a sharp knife.

If you have selected SPI bus, the default address for slave board is **0x77**(right-two pads are connected). If you want to use the address **0x76**, disconnect all three pads.
