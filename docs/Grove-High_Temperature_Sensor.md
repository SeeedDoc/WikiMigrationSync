Thermocouples are very sensitive devices. It requires a good amplifier with cold-junction compensation. The Grove - High Temperatire Sensor uses a K-Type themocouple and a thermocouple amplifier that measures ambient temperature using thermistor for cold-junction compensation. The detectable range of this Sensor is -50-600°C , and the accuracy is ±(2.0% + 2°C)

Platforms Supported
-------------------

Getting Started
---------------

Here is an example to show you how to read temperature information from the sensor.

We need a Seeeduino V3.0 and a Grove - High Temperature Sensor.

### Hardware Installation

A4 and A5 are the I2C lines of Seeduino. Plug the sensor to the I2C port of Seeeduino to read data.

### Download Code and Upload

You can download the library from [here](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_HighTemp_Sensor/archive/master.zip)

Then extract the library to the Library folder of Arduino, open the demo in examples folder.

Then upload it to your Seeeduino.

### Open Serial Monitor and Get Data

Then, open your Serial Monitor, you can find the temperature in Celsius here.
