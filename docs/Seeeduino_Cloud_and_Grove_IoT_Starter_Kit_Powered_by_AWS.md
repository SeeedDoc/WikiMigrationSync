*Main articles: Start here [Grove IoT Starter Kits Powered by AWS](/Grove_IoT_Starter_Kits_Powered_by_AWS "Grove IoT Starter Kits Powered by AWS") , [Seeeduino Cloud](/Seeeduino_Cloud "Seeeduino Cloud")*

**[Seeeduino Cloud](/Seeeduino_Cloud "Seeeduino Cloud")** is a microcontroller board based on Dragino WiFi IoT module [HE](http://www.dragino.com/products/linux-module/item/87-he.html) and ATmega32u4. **HE** is a high performance, low-cost 150M, 2.4G WiFi module which with an Open Source OpenWrt system inside. Seeeduino Cloud is also an [Arduino Yun](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardYun) compatible board. This kit includes most frequently used sensors and actuators to turn your ideas into tangible applications with AWS Cloud computing.

Configure Your AWS IoT Service
------------------------------

In this section, we will show how to:

1. Create an [AWS Account](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AMS5.0CreatingAnAWSAccount.html).

2. Go to [AWS IoT](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AMS5.0CreatingAnAWSAccount.html) and open the AWS IoT Dashboard.

Sign in with your AWS Account. Click the **Services** on the top-left corner, and then click on AWS IoT, as shown at below image.

Set up your Seeeduino Cloud (Arduino Yun)
-----------------------------------------

### Getting started with Seeeduino Cloud (Arduino Yun)

If this is your first time to use Seeeduino Cloud or Arduino Yun, you can click [here](/Seeeduino_Cloud) to get started. Before proceeding to the following steps, please make sure that you have **expect** installed on your computer and correctly installed the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases).

### Installation on Mac OS/Linux

Before proceeding to the following steps, please make sure that you have **expect** installed on your computer and correctly installed the Arduino IDE.

#### To install expect

For Ubuntu, simply run the following command. sudo apt-get install expect For Mac OS X, **expect** is installed as default.

#### To install Arduino IDE

For Arduino IDE installation on Linux, please visit here (<http://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/All>).

#### Set up development board

1.Set up the Arduino YÃºn board and connect it to WiFi. Obtain its IP address and password. If you donâ€™t know how to do it you can follow this [link](/Seeeduino_Cloud#Getting_Started).

2.Make sure your computer is connected to the same network (local IP address range).

3.Download the AWS IoT CA file from [here](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/VeriSign-Class%203-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem). And save it as *root-CA.crt*.

4.Put your AWS IoT CA file, private key and certificate into AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK/AWS-IoT-Python-Runtime/certs.

5.Open a terminal, cd to **AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK**. Do *chmod 755 AWSIoTArduinoYunInstallAll.sh* and execute it as:

```
./AWSIoTArduinoYunInstallAll.sh <Board IP> <UserName> <Board Password>.
```

By default for Seeeduino Cloud, your username will be root and your password will be seeeduino. Arduino YÃºn Board, your username will be root and your password will be Arduino.

For step 5, it can take 15-20 minutes for the device to download and install the required packages (distribute, python-OpenSSL, pip, paho-MQTT).

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
Do not close the terminal before the script finishes, otherwise you have to start over with step 5. Make sure you are in your local terminal before repeating step 5.
</div>

6.Copy and paste **AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK/AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-Library** folder into Arduino libraries that was installed with your Arduino SDK installation. For Mac OS default, it should be under **Documents/Arduino/libraries**.

7.Restart the Arduino IDE if it was running during the installation. You should be able to see the AWS IoT examples in the Examples folder in your IDE.

There are the other two scripts: **AWSIoTArduinoYunScp.sh** and **AWSIoTArduinoYunSetupEnvironment.sh**, which are utilized in **AWSIoTArduinoYunInstallAll.sh**. You can always use **AWSIoTArduinoYunScp.sh** to upload your new credentials to your board. When you are in the directory **AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK/**, the command should be something like this:

```
./AWSIoTArduinoYunScp.sh <Board IP> <UserName> <Board Password> <File> <Destination>
```

### Installation on Windows

Before proceeding to the following steps, please make sure that you have Putty and WinSCP installed on your PC. If you prefer to use other tools for SSH-ing into your Arduino YÃºn board and transferring files, you will have to adjust the steps below according to your tools. Putty can be downloaded from [here](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html). WinSCP can be downloaded from [here](http://winscp.net/eng/download.php). Set up the board.

1.Setup the Arduino YÃºn Cloud board and connect it to WiFi. Obtain its IP address and password. If you don't know how to do it, please follow this [link](/Seeeduino_Cloud#Getting_Started).

2.Make sure your PC is connected to the same network (local IP address range).

3.Download the AWS IoT CA file from [here](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/VeriSign-Class%203-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem). And save it as root-CA.crt

4.Put your AWS IoT CA file that you saved before, private key and certificate into folder **AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK/AWS-IoT-Python-Runtime/certs**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS/master/img/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS_set_up_arduino_yun_on_windows_copy_certs.png)

5.Start WinSCP and upload AWS-IoT-Python-Runtime/ folder to /root on the board.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS/master/img/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS_set_up_arduino_yun_on_windows_copy_run_time_file.png)

6.Use Putty to ssh into OpenWRT on your board and execute the following commands to install the necessary libraries:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS/master/img/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS_set_up_arduino_yun_on_windows_login_dragino.png)

It can take 15-20 minutes for the device to download and install the required packages.

7.Copy and paste AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK/AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-Library folder into Arduino libraries that was installed with your Arduino SDK installation. For Windows default, it should be under **Documents/Arduino/libraries**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS/master/img/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS_set_up_arduino_yun_on_windows_copy_AWS_library_file_to_arduino_library.png)

8.Restart the Arduino IDE if it was running during the installation. You should be able to see the AWS IoT examples in the Examples folder in your IDE.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS/master/img/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS_set_up_arduino_yun_on_windows_load_example.png)

### Connect Grove Module
