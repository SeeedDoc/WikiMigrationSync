This is a multifunctional sensor that gives you temperature and relative humidity information at the same time. It utilizes a TH02 sensor that can meet measurement needs of general purposes. It provides reliable readings when environment humidity condition in between 0-80% RH, and temperature condition in between 0-70°C, covering needs in most home and daily applications that don't contain extreme conditions.

The Temperature and Humidity sensor is connecting to analog port I2C of Grove - Base Shield.

-   Download [Grove_Temper_Humidity_TH02 library](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_Temper_Humidity_TH02) and install the library into Arduino libraries.

```
    /*
     * Demo name   : TH02_dev demo 
     * Usage       : DIGITAL I2C HUMIDITY AND TEMPERATURE SENSOR 
     * Author      : Oliver Wang from Seeed Studio
     * Version     : V0.1
    */

    #include <TH02_dev.h>
    #include "Arduino.h"
    #include "Wire.h" 
     
    void setup()
    {  
      Serial.begin(9600);        // start serial for output
      
      Serial.println("****TH02_dev demo by seeed studio****\n");
      /* Power up,delay 150ms,until voltage is stable */
      delay(150);
      /* Reset HP20x_dev */
      TH02.begin();
      delay(100);
      
      /* Determine TH02_dev is available or not */
      Serial.println("TH02_dev is available.\n");    
    }
     

    void loop()
    {
       float temper = TH02.ReadTemperature(); 
       Serial.println("Temperature: ");   
       Serial.print(temper);
       Serial.println("C\r\n");
       
       float humidity = TH02.ReadHumidity();
       Serial.println("Humidity: ");
       Serial.print(humidity);
       Serial.println("%\r\n");
       delay(1000);
    }
```


Upload it into your Arduino board and open the serial monitor to observe the temperature and relative humidity information of the environment.
