# Battery Detector with Polymer Lithium Ion 1050mAh 3.7V

Introduction
------------

![](assets/Battery_Detector_with_Polymer_Lithium_Ion_1050mAh_3.7V/img/Battery_Detector_with_Polymer_Lithium_Ion_1050mAh_3.7V.jpg)

Battery Detector with Polymer Lithium Ion 1050mAh 3.8V contains two items: a 1050 mAh lithium-ion battery and a battery power detector to measure the power remain in a li-ion battery.

The li-ion battery is very slim, light and cost effective. It output 3.7 V voltage(nominal). You can also charge it with a specialized charger which has maximum input current 1050 mA and maximum input voltage 4.2V. This battery comes with pre-attached JST 2.0 connector which is handy to click in and out. It also has built-in overcurrent protection to protect against output short circuit. **Although, please still take caution and do not abuse the battery in usage. Never charge or use it unattended.**

The battery power detector can detect the input voltage range of 3–4.2 volts. There are three JST sockets (JST 1.0, JST 2.0 and JST 2.0) and two battery-soldering pads will adapt to those batteries with a different connector. As you connect a battery to this battery power detector, the on-board four LEDs will indicate remaining power in percentage (0–25%, 26–50%, 51–75%, 76–100%). Another LED will be on if you plug the connector of battery in the wrong way.

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Notes</p>
<p> 1. There is only one battery reliable to be tested at the same time.</p>
<p> 2. It will damage this battery power detector as the input voltage is above 9 volts.</p>
<p> 3. Never use the battery when it is being charged.</p>
